## Nvidia Drivers and CUDA Toolkit configuration and verification for UBUNTU full guide

This guide aims to provide detailed steps for setting up Nvidia drivers and the CUDA toolkit on Ubuntu, allowing you to take full advantage of the parallel processing capabilities of Nvidia GPUs.

**Nvidia** is a leading company in the GPU market, specializing in graphics technology, artificial intelligence, machine learning and scientific computing, with high performance and parallel processing capabilities. The **CUDA** (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and programming model created by Nvidia, which allows developers to use GPUs for general-purpose computing tasks. Together with the Nvidia drivers, the CUDA Toolkit provides the tools needed to develop and optimize applications that take advantage of the power of Nvidia graphics cards.


- By using CUDA, you can transfer part of the workload from the processor (CPU) to the GPU, taking advantage of the parallel processing capability of Nvidia graphics cards. This results in much faster performance for tasks such as neural network training, 3D rendering and simulations. The CUDA Toolkit offers a series of libraries and tools that facilitate the development of AI applications, including deep neural networks, supervised and unsupervised learning, and analysis of large volumes of data. It is essential for any project involving deep learning and large volumes of data. To get the most out of Nvidia GPUs, you need to configure the drivers and the CUDA Toolkit correctly. This ensures that you are using the full capacity of your graphics card efficiently and without errors.
